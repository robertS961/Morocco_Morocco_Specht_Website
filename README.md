# MMS3
This project was created to build a full-stack website for the law firm Morocco, Morocco, and Specht. 
The AG Intro currently contains the back end and I am working on fussing them together. 
Once that is done it will be a fully operational full stack website and will be Utilized by Morocco, Morocco, and Specht. 

#Angular
Angular is used on the front end with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
The backend is using Firebase.
